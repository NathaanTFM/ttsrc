# This script is deprecated.  It used to be required by VR Studio
# users who were using the ctattach tools to de-Cygwinify the
# directories named in the PYTHONPATH variable after the ctattach
# tools filled it with Cygwin-style directories, but this is no longer
# necessary (the ctattach tools no longer touch PYTHONPATH).  In any
# case, it was never needed outside the VR Studio.
#
# It also de-cygwinified each of the directories named by the the
# $DTOOL, $PANDA, $DIRECT, etc. environment variables that ctattach
# filled in.  This might still be useful, but it's not clear (since we
# have the runPythonEmacs that does that instead).  For now, I've
# taken this behavior out of the script, and we'll see if anyone
# complains.
#
# This means that the only thing this script does nowadays is
# immediately launch Python.  It could be set up to launch the
# particular version of Python for which Panda has been built, but at
# the moment we don't really know that (it would have to be specified
# in the Config.pp file, and it's not, at least not completely).
