// dtool/Config.pp
//
// This file defines certain configuration variables that are written
// into the various make scripts.  It is processed by ppremake (along
// with the Sources.pp files in each of the various directories) to
// generate build scripts appropriate to each environment.
// 

// *******************************************************************
// NOTE: you should not attempt to copy this file verbatim as your own
// personal Config.pp file.  Instead, you should start with an empty
// Config.pp file, and add lines to it when you wish to override
// settings given in here.  In the normal ppremake system, this file
// will always be read first, and then your personal Config.pp file
// will be read later, which gives you a chance to override the
// default settings found in this file.  However, if you start by
// copying the entire file, it will be difficult to tell which
// settings you have customized, and it will be difficult to upgrade
// to a subsequent version of Panda.
// *******************************************************************

//
// ppremake is capable of generating makefiles for Unix compilers such
// as gcc or SGI's MipsPRO compiler, as well as for Windows
// environments like Microsoft's Visual C++.  It can also,
// potentially, generate Microsoft Developer's Studio project files
// directly, although we haven't written the scripts to do this yet.
// In principle, it can be extended to generate suitable build script
// files for any number of different build environments.
//
// All of these build scripts can be tuned for a particular
// environment via this file.  This is the place for the user to
// specify which external packages are installed and where, or to
// enable or disable certain optional features.  However, it is
// suggested that rather than modify this file directly, you create a
// custom file in your home directory and there redefine whatever
// variables are appropriate, and set the environment variable
// PPREMAKE_CONFIG to refer to it.  In this way, you can easily get an
// updated source tree (including a new Config.pp) without risking
// accidentally losing your customizations.  This also avoids having
// to redefine the same variables in different packages (for instance,
// in dtool and in panda).
//
// The syntax in this file resembles some hybrid between C++
// preprocessor declarations and GNU make variables.  This is the same
// syntax used in the various ppremake system configure files; it's
// designed to be easy to use as a macro language to generate
// makefiles and their ilk.
//
// Some of the variables below are defined using the #define command,
// and others are defined using #defer.  The two are very similar in
// their purpose; the difference is that, if the variable definition
// includes references to other variables (e.g. $[varname]), then
// #define will evaluate all of the other variable references
// immediately and store the resulting expansion, while #defer will
// store only the variable references themselves, and expand them when
// the variable is later referenced.  It is very similar to the
// relationship between := and = in GNU Make.
// dtool/Config.pp

// In general, #defer is used in this file, to allow the user to
// redefine critical variables in his or her own Config.pp file.



// What kind of build scripts are we generating?  This selects a
// suitable template file from the ppremake system files.  The
// allowable choices, at present, are:
//
//  unix      - Generate makefiles suitable for most Unix platforms.
//  msvc      - Generate Visual C++ project files (still a work in progress)
//  nmake     - Generate makefiles for Microsoft Visual C++, using 
//              Microsoft's nmake utility.
//  gmsvc     - Generate makefiles similar to the above, using Microsoft
//              Visual C++, but uses the Cygwin-supplied GNU make
//              instead of Microsoft nmake.  This is potentially
//              faster if you have multiple CPU's, since it supports
//              distributed make.  It's a tiny bit slower if you're
//              not taking advantage of distributed make, because of
//              the overhead associated with Cygwin fork() calls.

// What is the default install directory for all trees in the Panda

// You may also override this for a particular tree by defining a

// If you intend to use Panda only as a Python module, you may find

// always uses the forward slash, '/', to separate the components of a
// directory name.)

// There's a different character used to separate the complete
// directory names in a search path specification.  On Unix, the
// normal convention is ':', on Windows, it has to be ';', because the
// colon is already used to mark the drive letter.  This character is

// The default behavior is to search for files names *.prc in the
