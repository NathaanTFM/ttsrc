Cashbot Mint Editing
====================

Each floor of the Cashbot Mint comprises a linear string of rooms, chosen
at random from a central pool. There are three mints, and each mint has 20
floors.

You may specify a particular mint and/or a particular floor thus:

-before starting the game, config
mint-id #
mint-floor #

-after starting the game, use
~mintId #
~mintFloor #

Valid mintId values currently are 0, 1, or 2 (EASY,MEDIUM,HARD)

::THE IN-GAME EDITOR
====================

Once inside the mint, you may start up the in-game editor at any time. Just
stand in the room you wish to edit, and run '~edit'.

For more details on the in-game editor, see $OTP/src/doc/InGameEditor.txt

::ROOM SPECS
============

The level specs (output of the editor) for the mint rooms are Python files
stored in $TOONTOWN/src/coghq. They are named using the following
convention:

CashbotMint<ROOMNAME>_<ROOMTYPE><INDEX>.py

for instance,

CashbotMintBoilerRoom_Action00.py
CashbotMintBoilerRoom_Battle00.py

ROOMNAME identifies the room model, ROOMTYPE describes what has been added
to the room (if there are cogs, it's a Battle room, otherwise it's Action),
and INDEX allows for multiple Action or Battle rooms that share the same
ROOMNAME.

To add a new room to the room pool, you can either create a new spec from
scratch (see 'SPECS' in InGameEditor.txt) or you can make a copy of an
existing spec. Then add the spec name to one of the lists in
$TOONTOWN/src/coghq/MintRoomSpecs.py (choose a list depending whether the
room is an entrance, middle room, or final room)

::COGS
======

We currently don't have an entity type for cogs or battle cells, which
means that they cannot be placed and edited with the in-game editor. Ask
Darren if you need details on how to add Cogs.

Standard practice is to place NodePaths in the level with the editor, and
place the Cogs under that node. That way, even though you cannot
add/remove/edit the Cogs in the editor, you _can_ move them and rotate
them.

All of the above goes for battle cells as well.

::MISCELLANEOUS

the room he is standing in, as well as the name of the room.
