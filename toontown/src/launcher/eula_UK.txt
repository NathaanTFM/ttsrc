The structure,organisation and code of the Software are valuable trade secrets and confidential information of Disney and its licensors.
This is a licence agreement and not an agreement for sale or ownership.  Disney grants you,free of charge,a non-exclusive,non-assignable and non-transferable licence to use the Software on your computer. Disney does not transfer ownership in the Software to you.  Disney and its licensors retain ownership to the Software,and all intellectual property rights therein.  You may not redistribute,sell or sub-license the Software.

You hereby undertake to comply with the House Rules when accessing and using the Service.

The Software must not be shipped,transferred,exported,downloaded or installed into any country or used in any manner prohibited by international import or export laws,restrictions or regulations.
We will compensate you for any loss or damage you may suffer if we fail to carry out our obligations under this Agreement to a reasonable standard or breach any duties imposed on us by law (including if we cause death or personal injury by our negligence) unless that failure is attributed to: (a) your own fault; (b) a third party unconnected with our provision of the Software under this Agreement; or (c) events which neither we nor our suppliers could have foreseen or forestalled even if we have taken reasonable care. We shall not be responsible for loss of or damage to your computer hardware or software or other personal property or any other losses which you suffer as a result of installing and operating the Software unless this is due to our neglect or failure to take reasonable precautions and such losses are reasonably foreseeable.

This Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from Disney or its licensors if you fail to comply with any term herein or in any of the other Toontown Terms (as defined in the Member Agreement).  You may also terminate the Agreement without notice at any time. Upon termination,you must erase the Software from all computer memories and storage devices within your possession or control.
These terms and conditions constitute the entire agreement between Disney and you and supersede any other communications or advertising with respect to the Software. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the relevant territory within the UK in which you live and the courts of that territory shall have exclusive jurisdiction.  For future reference you should print out a copy of this Agreement,which in any event will be automatically stored in the hard drive of your computer as the Software is being installed.  We may need to amend these terms from time to time for operational reasons. Changes will be displayed on the Service. Permanent changes will only be made after not less than one month's notice. If any material changes to this Agreement are unacceptable to you,or cause you to no longer be in compliance with this Agreement,you may terminate this Agreement. Your continued use of the Service following notice of changes to this Agreement (or any of the Toontown Terms) will be deemed to mean you accept those changes. 

Please note that our rights under these terms remain in force at all times. If we do not enforce any or all of these rights for any period it does not mean that we have decided to give them up.
